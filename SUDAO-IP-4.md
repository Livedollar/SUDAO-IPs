## SUDAO-IP-4: Governance Snapshot Quorum

## Rationale

- As it stands the Snapshot quorum is fully dependent on how many members have voted on the Discourse.
- With weighted voting it makes more sense for quorum to be 50% of the total voting power of the entire DAO.
- Currently to increase the chance of a proposal going through, you want less members to participate in the Discourse formal governance process to decrease the quorum on Snapshot
- It would be beneficial to have good showings for every vote and to have the majority of members actively participating and be aware of any potential changes to the DAO.

## Content of the Proposal:

Change the quorum on snapshot to 50% of the total voting power of the DAO from 50% of the number of members that voted on the discourse formal proposal.
