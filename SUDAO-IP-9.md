## SUDAO-IP-9: Stables Compensation Withholding due to Inactivity

## Rationale

There have been incidents ,each epoch, when a DAO member goes inactive for a long period of time without notice. We don’t have a process other than offboarding to alumni, every 6 weeks, to put a stop to stables compensation. This process will give the DAO a quicker way to prevent compensating an inactive member on a monthly basis so as to better utilize the DAO’s resources.

**This document is to ratify the process to withhold compensation due to inactivity.**

- Create an ‘Out of Office’ channel in discord so members of the DAO can give notice when they expect to be out of the office and the duration.

- Operations team will do a check-up on all members of the DAO that receive stables compensation at the beginning of each month. They will use discord, dework, check the ‘Out of Office’ discord channel, and confer with team leads to confirm whether any member should be considered inactive.

- If any member is deemed inactive they will be placed on an inactive list and contacted via DM’s to be made aware. This will give them a chance to show proof of work done for the DAO during that month in the ‘inactive thread’. They will also be provided a link to that thread.

- The ‘inactive thread’ will be within the ‘SuperUMAn Lair’ channel on discord. It will contain the list of inactive members and be open for 5 days.

- Similar to the ‘Alumni Promotions’ each member will need 8 SuperUMAns, 4 of which are UMAsters, to react to their name if they believe that that individual should be taken off the inactive list.

- If they fail to be taken off the list after 5 days, they will be added to the next snapshot distribution proposal, the proposal that distributes the stables compensation for that month, as ‘inactive members’. This will also include their compensation tier level. That proposal will not have these members on the payout list for that distribution. Effectively distributing funds and preventing ‘inactive’ members from getting compensated.

- This will not change the tier of the individual as that will be decided during the alumni promotions.

## Reasoning:

- An ‘Out of Office’ channel will allow any member to officially give the DAO notice of when they’ll be unavailable. This will be taken into consideration when determining inactivity for that month.

- Operations is already doing a similar check for alumni promotions of activity every ~6 weeks… We can apply that process of determining activity to this one.

- There’s no way to actually confirm with 100% confidence that someone has been inactive without giving them a chance to defend themself. That is why we contact them and allow them 5 days to be given a chance to show proof of work.

- Compensation withholding is a big deal and needing the support of 8 SuperUMAns, 4 of which are UMAsters seems reasonable. Because this process is similar to tier membership changes, if they aren’t taken off the inactive list, would go through the same process of a 24 hour snapshot vote with no quorum and simple majority

**Within Managing the Treasury of the SuperUMAn DAO after Compensation to Contributors:**

Stables Compensation Withholding due to Inactivity

At the beginning of each month there will be an activity check for the previous month by the operations team. DAO members that receive stables compensation will be checked for contributions to the DAO during that month. This check will include discord activity, dework task completions, the ‘Out of Office’ channel, and conferring with team leads. If a member is still deemed inactive they will be contacted via DM with a link to the ‘inactive thread’.

This ‘inactive thread’ will be within the SuperUMAn lair channel and will contain the inactive list. Each inactive member will be listed separately and must receive at least 8 SuperUMAn votes, 4 of them being UMAsters, to be taken off this list. This thread will remain open for 5 days. If after 5 days the member hasn’t been taken off the list then they will be added to the next snapshot distribution proposal, the proposal that distributes the stables compensation for that month, as ‘inactive members’. This will also include their compensation tier level. That proposal will not have these members on the payout list for that distribution.
